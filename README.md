**Solaria-GPT** is an AI-driven tool designed to assist in **usability inspection** by detecting defects and classifying heuristic violations. Built on top of ChatGPT, the system supports two types of input formats:

- 📝 **Text Input** — A textual description of a usability defect.
- 🖼️ **Media Input** — A screenshot of the system interface or a video showcasing user interaction/navigation.
